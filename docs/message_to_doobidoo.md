Hey @doobidoo! 

I've been using your Memory Service MCP and it's fantastic! I created a companion GUI tool called Memory Defragmenter that helps users:

- 🔍 Visualize memory usage and find duplicates
- 🎯 Optimize ChromaDB performance by merging similar memories
- 🛡️ Backup/export memories with automatic safety features
- 📊 Analyze memory patterns with interactive charts

Just released v1.0.0: https://github.com/M-Pineapple/Memory-Defragmenter

It's specifically built for Memory Service MCP databases and includes proper attribution to your excellent work. The tools work great together - your MCP handles the storage/retrieval, and my app helps users maintain and optimize their memory databases over time.

Would love to cross-promote if you're interested - happy to add links to your repo in my README (already have attribution there). Feel free to check it out and let me know if you'd like to collaborate in any way!

Thanks for creating such a solid foundation to build on!
