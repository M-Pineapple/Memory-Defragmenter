### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Follow the Swift style guide
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
* Document new code
* End all files with a newline

## Development Process

1. **Fork & Clone**: Fork the repo and clone it locally
2. **Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature/fix
3. **Code**: Make your changes following our coding standards
4. **Test**: Add/update tests as needed
5. **Commit**: Use clear commit messages
6. **Push**: Push your branch to your fork
7. **PR**: Submit a pull request

## Swift Style Guide

### Code Formatting

* Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
* Maximum line length of 120 characters
* Use descriptive variable names
* Follow Swift API Design Guidelines

### Example:
```swift
// Good
func analyzeMemoryDatabase(at path: String) throws -> AnalysisResult {
    guard FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) else {
        throw DatabaseError.fileNotFound
    }
    // Implementation
}

// Bad
func analyze(_ p: String) -> Result? {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Documentation

* Use triple-slash comments for public APIs
* Include parameter descriptions
* Add usage examples for complex functions

```swift
/// Analyzes a Memory MCP database for duplicate entries
/// - Parameter path: The file path to the SQLite database
/// - Returns: An AnalysisResult containing duplicate clusters
/// - Throws: DatabaseError if the file cannot be read
func analyzeMemoryDatabase(at path: String) throws -> AnalysisResult
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

* Write tests for all new functionality
* Maintain code coverage above 80%
* Use descriptive test names

```swift
func testAnalysisFindsExactDuplicates() throws {
    // Test implementation
}
```

### UI Tests

* Test critical user workflows
* Include both happy path and error scenarios
* Use accessibility identifiers for UI elements

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Examples:
```
Add PDF export functionality for analysis reports

- Implement NSPrintOperation for PDF generation
- Add export menu with multiple format options
- Include unit tests for export manager

Fixes #123
```
