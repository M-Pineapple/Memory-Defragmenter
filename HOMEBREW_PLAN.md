# Memory Defragmenter - Homebrew Release Plan

## Phase 1: DMG Release (Immediate)
1. Build and notarize DMG
2. Create GitHub release with DMG
3. Get initial user feedback
4. Fix any critical issues

## Phase 2: Personal Homebrew Tap (Week 1-2)
1. Create new repo: `homebrew-memory-defragmenter`
2. Add the cask formula
3. Test installation process
4. Document in README:
   ```bash
   brew tap yourusername/memory-defragmenter
   brew install --cask memory-defragmenter
   ```

## Phase 3: Homebrew Cask Submission (After 1 month)
1. Ensure app is stable with no major issues
2. Fork homebrew-cask
3. Add your formula to Casks/m/memory-defragmenter.rb
4. Submit PR with:
   - Proper formula
   - Test results
   - Link to active project

## Advantages of This Approach
- **Immediate availability**: DMG gets you started
- **Growing trust**: Personal tap builds credibility
- **Maximum reach**: Official cask gives discoverability
- **Fallback options**: Users can choose their preferred method

## Formula Maintenance
- Update SHA256 for each release
